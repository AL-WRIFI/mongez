| {{ moduleName }} Admin Routes
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------
|
| Here is where you can register API routes for your admin "back office/dashboard" application.
| Please note that this file is auto imported in the main routes file, so it will inherit the main "prefix"
| and "namespace", so don't edit it to add for example "admin" as a prefix. 
| 
| Also, all routes have `admin.` as route name prefix so it prevents the duplicate routes conflict.
|
| If route method is set to restfulApi() then api resource is patchable and therfore a PATCH handler
| method is added automatically to AdminApiController.
